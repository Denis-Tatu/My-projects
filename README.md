# My-projects
This repository contains some of my projects.

The purpose of ths repository is, not only to reflect my skills as a programmer, but also to show others my take on a variety of problems related to computer-science and information technology.
Note that some of these programs and scripts have begun in my college years as they were mandatory for my classes and, while tweaked after graduating, may contain touches and ideas from my former teachers and colleagues.
